  Getting Started with JuiceKit\231
  ---------------------------------

Overview

  The following sections taking you through downloading and building the SDK.
  To use to JuiceKit\231 for Flex library, you must include a copy
  of <<<flexlib-${currentVersion}.swc>>> in your Flex project's build path.

  If you are using Flex Builder 3, the simplest approach is to copy
  <<<flexlib-${currentVersion}.swc>>> into your Flex project's libs directory.
  The other approach is to modify your Flex project's
  "Properties > Flex Build Path > Library Path > Add SWC..." and
  select the <<<flexlib-${currentVersion}.swc>>> file.


Requirements

  You need to have the following technologies to download and build the source.

  * {{{http://git-scm.com/}Git}}, an open source, distributed version control system

  * {{{http://maven.apache.org/}Apache Maven 2}}, an open source software project management tool


Downloading the source

  You download the current source code from {{{http://github.com/jonbuffington/juicekit/tree/master}Github}} by cloning the repository.

+-------------------------------+
$ git clone git://github.com/jonbuffington/juicekit.git
+-------------------------------+

  After cloning JuiceKit from github you need to do a submodule update to pull in the patched flare library:

+-------------------------------+
$ cd juicekit
$ git submodule update -i
+-------------------------------+

Building the source

  The following command assumes you are using a Bourne/Bash shell (the default on many operating systems). To build the the library from source, issue the following Maven2 command.

+-------------------------------+
$ MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms64m -Xmx256m" mvn clean install site
+-------------------------------+

  After the build completes, you will find the <<<flexlib-${currentVersion}.swc>>> library in <<<flexlib/target/>>> directory. The flexlib API documentation index will be located at <<<flexlib/target/site/asdoc/index.html>>>.
